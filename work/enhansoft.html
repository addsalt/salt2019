<!-- PROJECT INFO -->
<div class="project-intro">
    <h1>Enhansoft</h1>
    <h2>Website Design.</h2>
    <p>We were approached by Enhansoft, a long-established software development company, to refresh their website. Our main goal was to create a user-friendly, easily manageable site that increased conversions, while giving the site a visual facelift. We set out to capture the capabilities of the Enhansoft team through a sleek, easy-to-navigate site. Subtle gradients and re-imagined graphics created a polished and dependable feel, while clear breakdowns, access points, and navigation allowed Enhansoft to grow their registered user base after launch.</p>
